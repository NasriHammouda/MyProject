# MyProject
Name Generator

I made this project as a way for me to learn Python and also web development.
And the idea is to make a web app that generate names in different languages randomly.

Things to learn:
    - Python and Flask as a web framework
    - How to web works (protocols , hosting, security)
    - some HTML and CSS and tiny bit of javascript with the use of famous frameworks like bootstrap.js and react.js
